MPAX Core — Sales Event Configuration Engine (SECE)
Project Brief v8.0 — Configuration‑First, Event‑Driven Platform

Focus statement
MPAX turns high‑value asset sales into premium, AI‑guided “Sales Events” that learn each buyer’s preferences and lift conversion—without custom engineering per category. The MPAX core is a configuration engine that sets up and operates each event end‑to‑end: persona, discovery behavior, search/ranking, UI contract, conversion paths, safety, and analytics.

What we’re building (SECE)
The Sales Event Configuration Engine is the thin, reusable core that:
- Defines an event by configuration, not code.
- Orchestrates conversation, search, recommendations, UI updates, and conversion using those configs.
- Emits operational and revenue telemetry to optimize the next event.

Sales Event = configuration (no code)
A Sales Event is a versioned config bundle applied at runtime.

Minimal schema (authoritative surfaces)
- Persona and questioning style
- Preference signals to extract and track
- Search defaults and data sources
- Ranking weights and trade‑off rules
- UI contract (tiles, chips, comparisons, actions)
- Conversion flow (reserve, consult, deposit, reveal)
- Scarcity/social proof policy
- Safety/compliance policy
- Analytics and A/B test plan

Example: platform defaults
Save as `engines/de/src/discovery_engine/config/platform_defaults.json`
```json

Sales Event lifecycle (runbook)
- Configure: Admin selects a template, fills event metadata, attaches data sources, and publishes. No code changes.
- Operate: The event runs with real‑time conversation, search, ranking, UI updates, scarcity signals, and conversion flows—entirely driven by config.
- Optimize: A/B plans execute automatically; telemetry feeds back into configuration suggestions.
- Close out: Reports, payouts, and learnings are exported; the config and analytics are versioned for reuse.

Roles and permissions
- Admin: Creates and publishes events, assigns templates, sets policies.
- Operator: Monitors performance, adjusts safe levers (e.g., ranking weights), triggers drops.
- Specialist (optional): Joins human handoffs from TFE.
- Buyer/Prospect: Interacts via chat/UI; can opt for holds, consults, or reveal.
- Partner/Dealer (B2B2C): Sees anonymized leads per RLS; pays usage‑based fees upon milestones.

Core APIs (stable contracts)
- `POST /api/v1/admin/sales_event` → create/publish from config
- `GET /api/v1/sales_event/{id}` → fetch UI bootstrap, tiles contract
- `POST /api/v1/discovery/start` → start session for event
- `POST /api/v1/discovery/message` → extract signals, search/re‑rank, UI updates
- `POST /api/v1/transaction/reserve` → hold/deposit; returns reservation details
- Optional B2B2C:
  - `GET /api/v1/dealer/prospects`
  - `POST /api/v1/dealer/messages`
  - `POST /api/v1/dealer/reveal-request`
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/event/{id}` → KPIs, A/B results

Architecture at a glance (kept thin)
- Discovery Engine services: `conversation_engine`, `search_engine`, `recommendation_engine`, `ui_controller`, `individual_modeler`, orchestrated by `discovery_engine`.
- Data/security: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector) with RLS; Zep Cloud memory; Redis optional.
- AI: Mistral (OCR/embeddings/chat) + Groq for test‑time variants and Judge scoring.
- Delivery: Cloudflare CDN for media; WebSocket updates for UI.
- Everything parameterized by the Sales Event config.

Lower‑overhead options (fresh ideas)
- Start pgvector‑only hybrid search, defer knowledge‑graph layers; add materialized views for common filters instead of a custom KG service.
- Use Supabase Realtime + Postgres functions to broadcast reservation and badge changes; reserve Redis Streams for high‑throughput phases later.
- Encode safety/compliance as “policy‑as‑config” with JSON Schema validation and approval status; no bespoke policy code per category.
- Replace long‑lived Celery workers with Supabase Functions/Edge Functions for light admin tasks; keep Groq/Mistral calls stateless.
- Use YAML for authoring configs with JSON Schema validation; compile to JSON at publish time to avoid runtime parsing complexity.

Operating model (dates are explicit; today is October 25, 2025)
- Sprint 0 (Oct 27–Nov 9, 2025): Config engine + admin publish path
  - Deliver: `behavioral_config.py`, `sales_event_config.py`, validator, “Preview Event” sandbox.
  - Gate: Launch a dummy event end‑to‑end in staging without code edits.
- Sprints 1–2 (Nov 10–Dec 7, 2025): First live Sales Event (EVs)
  - Deliver: Discovery Engine minimal (conversation/search/re‑rank/UI), WebSocket updates, TFE reserve.
  - Gate: p95 <200 ms responses; <3 minutes to first relevant match.
- Sprints 3–4 (Dec 8, 2025–Jan 4, 2026): Second event + B2B2C module
  - Deliver: Watches event; Used Cars dealer portal (anon lead flow).
  - Gate: ≥25% lift vs. static baseline on at least one A/B.
- Sprints 5–6 (Jan 5–Feb 2, 2026): Scale and package
  - Deliver: SaaS packaging, compliance packs, dashboard KPIs, config templates library.
  - Gate: Three events completed; “new category in <5 minutes” demo recorded.

Success metrics (event‑level and platform‑level)
- Experience: <3 minutes to first relevant match; >4.8/5 “felt understood.”
- Conversion: >25% discovery→inquiry; 20–30% inquiry→deposit; >85% deposit→sale.
- Performance: p95 personalized response <200 ms; WebSocket latency <50 ms; 99.9% uptime.
- Efficiency: <5 minutes to configure a new category; <30 seconds per listing update.
- Governance: 100% configs validated and versioned; change log ties to KPI deltas.

Risk register (with mitigations)
- Latency at concurrency: Pre‑warm embeddings, result caching, circuit breakers; staged load tests each sprint.
- Compliance variance (title/authenticity/zoning): Safety pack per event with mandatory approval; RLS isolation; audit logs.
- Drift from “config‑first”: Introduce config review gates; disallow domain‑specific code merges without CTO sign‑off.
- Single‑vendor risk: Abstract AI endpoints; keep model‑agnostic adapters; support drop‑in alternatives later.

Current readiness
- Stack provisioned: Supabase (RLS), Zep Cloud, Cloudflare CDN, Mistral AI, Groq Services are set up and ready.
- Preserved building blocks: `state_schema.py`, `memory/zep_integration.py`, `individual_lock_service.py`, `langgraph_workflow.py`.
- INE+MSE: Operational and feeding real inventory/media.

Deliverables checklist (what this brief authorizes)
- Config engine
  - JSON Schema for `platform_defaults`, `behavior_templates`, `sales_events`
  - Admin publish/validate preview flow
- Discovery Engine minimal
  - Conversation (signals + variants + Judge), search (pgvector hybrid), recommendation (weights), UI controller (tiles/chips/compare/actions)
  - TFE reserve/hold via API; reservation timers and badges
- Templates library
  - `platform_defaults.json`
  - `tesla_q1_2026.json` (EVs)
  - `used_cars_b2b2c_otto.json` (dealer marketplace)
  - Optional: `watches_q1_2026.json`
- Analytics
  - Event KPIs API, A/B harness, nightly rollups

Appendix: event operator’s “one‑pager” SOP
- Create Sales Event → choose template → attach data source(s) → set conversion actions → publish.
- Monitor dashboard: time‑to‑match, step‑through, holds, deposits, reveal requests.
- Adjust safe levers: ranking weights ±5–10%, scarcity on/off, copy variants (A/B).
- Close event: payouts, export learnings; clone config for next run.

If approved, I will:
- Save this as `docs/business/briefs/MPAX_SECE_Project_Brief_v8.0.md`.
- Generate JSON Schemas for config validation and commit starter templates.
- Ship a “Hello, Sales Event” demo that proves zero‑code launch from config within Sprint 0.
